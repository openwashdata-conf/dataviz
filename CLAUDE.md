# dataviz
Instructions:
    I want a few functions, i don't know how to organize them. I want functions to just quickly plot data. This means i just want to give maybe X and Y data and the function will figure out how many subplots based on the input data (array or list of list etc.) Also maybe a color where i can input a section for color with a color bar. I don't know how much explicit instructions are needed like put color bar or axis lables. Usually the data is just a pandas dataframe and then i would maybe select the columns. Maybe do different functions. I would also love a continuesly updating plot. But as i do not have my sensor here you would need a function to simulate sensor output.
    In addition to simple live data i would love a dashboard for my sensor that reveics serial signals and then has multiple live plots and so on.

    for data look into the projects biogas-sensor. There are two projects, calibration and my senosor firmware.
    Then pls put everything in this prject dataviz.
